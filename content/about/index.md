Hello people! I'm Ruman Saleem ([@ruman_saleem](//twitter.com/ruman_saleem)), a full-stack web developer and a student, 
doing _M.Sc. Computer Science_ from the [Department of Computer Science, Delhi University](//cs.du.ac.in). 


I'm passionate about building websites. I love building beautiful user interfaces and working with new technologies and frameworks. 
My favorite tech stack is Laravel, Vue and Tailwind CSS (an awesome utility-first CSS framework).
I also work with Express.js and CodeIgniter. You might want to check out my [work](/work).


I occasionally write about my experiences and the new things I learn along the way of building websites.
Check out my [blog](/blog).


I am currently looking for a full-time job, and available for freelance projects (part-time). 
Here's my [resume](/resume), if you're interested in hiring me.
